   ??? param chnage or nothing??
Message pattern in AccountInfo. An account owner can set a regular expression
pattern in the AccountInfo for his account, using the setAccountInfo API.
Once such a pattern has been set, incoming transactions to this account are only
accepted if they contain a plain text message which matches this pattern. The
syntax follows the java.util.regex.Pattern specification.

New API calls for peer management: addPeer and blacklistPeer. AddPeer will add
a peer address or IP, optionally with port number, to the list of known peers
and will try to connect to it. BlacklistPeer (password protected) will
blacklist a peer, for the default blacklisting period.

These APIs, and a few others related to peer networking, have been grouped under
a new Networking tab on the /test page.

param changes

-rw-rw---- 1 azure azure 1535 Feb  3 07:04 nxt-client-1.3.5.changelog.txt

 
Added completed parameter to getDGSGoodsPurchases, getDGSGoodsPurchaseCount,
getDGSPurchaseCount, getDGSPurchases, to allow querying for completed purchases
only. Added withPublicFeedbacksOnly parameter to getDGSPurchaseCount.



Include full peer info in getPeers API if includePeerInfo=true, to avoid having
to do a separate getPeer request for each peer.

Allow transaction signing in signTransaction to skip the validation of the
transaction bytes being signed, if an optional validate=false parameter is added.
This would be useful when signing transaction bytes on a machine that doesn't have
the full blockchain downloaded, which normally prevents validation.

API changes:

After MS block, adding a public key announcement when sending a transaction to
an account without a public key will be optional.

Added withMessage boolean parameter to getAccountTransactions and 
getAccountTransactionIds APIs, to return only transactions having a message
attachment, either non-encrypted or decryptable by the account.

Added optional includeLessors, includeAssets, and includeCurrencies boolean
parameters to getAccount API. Set to false when retrieving those data is not
needed, in order to improve the getAccount performance.

After MS block, sending messages, selling aliases, and leasing balances, to the
Genesis account, will be disallowed.

The popOff debug API now allows pop off of more than max rollback number of
blocks, triggering a full rescan in such case.

Added availableOnly parameter to getBuyOffers and getSellOffers, to return
only exchange offers with non-zero supply and limit, default false. This
parameter is however ignored when both currency and account are specified in
the above APIs.

Forging API improvements: getForging and stopForging now allow access using
admin password instead of account secret phrase. This respectively retrieves
the status of, or stops the forging of, all currently forging accounts. As
with other admin password protected APIs, password is not required when the
API server is listening on the localhost interface only. The getState API now
also returns a needsAdminPassword boolean, to indicate this.
