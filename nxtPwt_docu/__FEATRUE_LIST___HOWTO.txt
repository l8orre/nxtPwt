Roadmap
1.) Move current version of my code to XE5 and release closed source 32-bit and 64-bit versions for Windows. [DONE]
2.) Refactor code to a MVC architecture, so that I can create separate GUIs while using the same version of the business logic code. [DONE]
3.) Create new GUIs for Windows and OS X using the same business logic, but based on the cross-platform Firemonkey libraries. [DONE]
4.) Release Windows version (32 and 64 bit) based on FireMonkey. [DONE]
5.) Implement new features from the TODO list [DONE]
6.) Release source-code for FireMonkey Windows version (February 16th, 2014 latest) [DONE]
7.) Implement new features from the TODO list
8.) OSX compatibility changes
9.) Release OSX version based on FireMonkey.
10.) Release source code for FireMonkey OSX version.


I've reached the end of my roadmap! :-)


TODO list
-Arbitrary message encryption
-Offer a simple and advanced GUI, with the simple GUI targeted at new users
