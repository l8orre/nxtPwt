If you want to legally prohibit people  from redistributing and using your code in other projects, copyright law already does that.  Open source doesn't mean anyone can use it if you have a copyright notice on the code.

This no difference between software and images copyright.

Simply add on top of every source file:

/*
 * Developer : Developer Name (example@example.com)
 * Date : xx/yy/zzzz
 * All code (c)2014 name -- all rights reserved
* You may not use, copy, or distribute the code without written permission from the  developer
*
 */

Yeah it's as simple as that.

That makes it illegal to use the code without developer's permission.



This actually is the most restrictive form of license you can release your code under. According to this, every time your code is called or executed you need written permission from the developer. The mainstream open source licenses are what you want to be considering; as they have well thought-out mechanisms to permit your code to be useful yet restrictive enough to prohibit exploitative uses.
