Welcome to nxtPowertools Jul.1., 2014



Please Note: This is a PowerTool under active development.

The focus is twofold:

1: provide a pythonic, fully open sourced NXT api implementation
2: provide a trade station for the NXT Asset Exchange

Features:

MainWin:
- sending Money
- polling account, balances, public key

Asset Exchange:

- issue Asset
- transfer Asset 
- place Order (B/A)
- cancel Order (B/A)

- clickable Assets to quickly acccess pending orders.
- clickable OrderBook for slated Asset - Automatch clicked Order for fast order placement.

API ACCESS:

- 49 NRS API calls, individually accessible.
- addition of further API calls can be done in ~30 Minutes.




Issues and Remarks: 

The server queries are delivered with 'POST'. https is not implemented yet - ONLY USE ON LOCALHOST OR TRUSTED SUBNETS - OR TESTNET!

This is an ongoing work. Further documentation will be added.


A transaction logfile is created, by default under the name: ___nxt_transaction.log

The connection url has to be entered on the main win as: http://localhost:6876

The line edit on API access is for display only, the connection can not be changed there.

This is written to in 'append' mode.

To SEND MONEY, each line edit (recipient, fee, amount, deadline) must be confirmed with a <return> key.
